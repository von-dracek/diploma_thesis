This thesis deals with multistage stochastic programs and explores the dependence of the obtained objective value on the chosen structure of the scenario tree. In particular, the scenario trees are built using the moment matching method, a multistage mean-CVaR model is formulated and a reinforcement learning agent is trained to choose the best scenario tree structure. Further an inclusion of a penalty term in the reward obtained by the agent is proposed to avoid scenario trees that are too complex.
