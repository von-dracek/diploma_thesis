Structure of thesis:
Introduction
Multistage stochastic programming problems
-multistage idea, nonanticipativity constraints, deterministic equivalent
-curse of dimensionality
-scenario trees 
    -moment matching, geometric brownian motion + clustering
Risk measures
-VaR, CVaR, minimisation, L shaped method, reformulating as a multistage program
Reinforcement learning
-introduction, comparison to other types (supervised etc), no loss function - inspiration from learning of animals and men
-Basic idea
-Multiarmed bandits
Study
-Formulation of the whole problem (idea of thesis)
    -Idea how to evaluate
    -Penalisation of result using complexity of tree with a hyperparameter - explain reasoning why we should penalise the result - why are complex scenario trees bad (long computation time, ...)?
-Data
-Computational problems, complexity, how long does solving each small problem take
-Results of the study
